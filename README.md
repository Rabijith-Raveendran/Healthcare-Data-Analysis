  <h1>Health Care Analysis</h1>
Welcome to the Healthcare Analysis project repository! This project aims to analyze a healthcare dataset using Power BI to uncover insights and trends in patient demographics and healthcare costs.

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this project I analyze the healthcare dataset and try to get enough insights based on the data to make better decisions for the patients healthcare. Before that I need to clean, transform, analyze the data, so thatt it could be more easier to draw enough visualizations.

<h2>Overview of the dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:

Days Spent: Number of days that the patients spent in the hospital
medical condition: Medical condition of the patients

<h2>Analysis Steps</h2>
Data Understanding: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's ready for analysis
Visualization: Create visualizations that highlight key findings in the data
Report taking: Interpret the results of analysis and derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making in the healthcare domain

<h2>Report of the Analysis</h2>
Disease Analysis Report:
Cancer expenses significantly surpass those of other diseases, with arthritis incurring the least expenditure.
